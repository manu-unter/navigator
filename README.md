# navigator
A file system navigator, written as a test assignment for JetBrains

## Functional Requirements
- [x] Tree view of the file system
- [x] Preview panel on the side
- [x] Extensible tree, with capabilities to display other formats than just the file system as nodes - e.g. zip files
- [ ] TBD: Icons?
- [ ] Keyboard Navigation & Accessibility

## Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Polished and consistent UI with carefully designed:
    - [ ] spacing
    - [ ] animations
    - [ ] typography
    - [ ] colors
- [ ] TBD: Performance? How many nodes can it display before stuttering? Virtualization? Lazy loading?
  
  I'll start without any of that and see how far that will get me
- [ ] TBD: Test Coverage?
  
  I'll go exploratory for now and add it later if I feel like I have the time
